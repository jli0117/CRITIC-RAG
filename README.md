# CRITIC-RAG: Verification-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Medical QA

CRITIC-RAG is a novel framework designed to enhance the factual accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of medical question answering. By integrating an instruction-tuned verifier throughout the RAG pipeline, CRITIC-RAG systematically filters irrelevant information, verifies answer grounding, and enables structured multi-step reasoning.

## üß† Key Features

- **Retrieve-on-Demand**: Determines whether external retrieval is necessary based on query complexity.
- **Evidence Filtering**: Filters retrieved content using a verifier model to ensure relevance.
- **Self-Consistency via Clustering**: Clusters evidence and samples diverse subsets for multi-path reasoning.
- **Groundedness Verification**: Selects the most reliable answer based on evidence alignment scores.
- **Plug-and-Play**: Designed for easy integration with a variety of LLMs without major architectural changes.
